Using Tableau to Explore the amazon sales database.
# ---------------------------Business Objective----------------------------------
The Shipping Manager doesn't have much visibility and doesn't know how many orders are processed and shipped on a monthly basis. 
He would like a dashboard of this where he selects a month and can tell how many orders are outstanding a day and where they should be shipped.
